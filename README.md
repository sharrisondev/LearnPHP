**Project 1 - World Traveler**
Hello there, friend! We’re exhausted having just returned to New York City from a whirlwind of world travel. We’re bringing all our international currency to the bank to be exchanged for USD. Our travels have made us wise and weary, and we want to ensure we’re being treated fairly. Can you help?
Write a program to calculate exactly how much cash in USD we should end up with after it has all been exchanged.

**Project 2 - Mad Lib Functions**
In this project, we’ll use PHP to write a function to fill in a Mad Libs story! Mad Libs are short stories with blank spaces, which get filled in by the user. Based on the poem The last stanza of Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening".
